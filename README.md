# Restaurant_Game
CEBP Project - Game based on concurrency problems
In this game besides from Vanilla Java, it was also used RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ was used as a pipe between two different executables.
One of them contains the game logic and the other the service providing the score and other game related data.
